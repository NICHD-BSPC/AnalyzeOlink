Description: AnalyzeOlink provides a configurable framework for analyzing
 Olink Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) data, including differential abundance
 testing and downstream validation. Supported statistical methods include Type
 III ANCOVA and linear mixed-effects models (via the 'afex' package), t-tests
 and Wilcoxon tests (paired and unpaired), as well as Kruskal–Wallis and
 Friedman tests. The package includes nine R Markdown analysis reports that
 cover key workflow components such as assumption checks for ANOVA and LMER
 models, leave-one-out sensitivity analyses for model terms and sample-level
 robustness, ELISA validation, and non-parametric covariate effect and NPX
 correlations testing. An annotations module integrates Human Protein Atlas
 (HPA) metadata, including tissue- and cell-type–specific expression profiles
 and Tau specificity scores, enabling annotation of downstream visualizations
 such as volcano plots and estimate-vs-estimate comparisons.
